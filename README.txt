Using the DcmSequence class in the DCMSequence.py file you can load in dicom directories or single files and perform the following 
operations on the images:

    Resize
    Normalize to 0-255 range
    Convert 16-bit to 8-bit
    Get png images of the dicom's pixel arrays
    
And you can choose to save the dicoms using the exact same name to some new directory.
